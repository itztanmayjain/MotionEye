# MotionEye

The Motion Detection Camera is a Python project that utilizes computer vision techniques to detect motion in a given area using a webcam or any video input device. When motion is detected in an empty room, the system triggers an alarm and captures a picture of the moving object for further analysis or recording.


## Features

- Real-time motion detection using computer vision algorithms.
- Capturing images of moving objects for further analysis 
- Triggering of an alarm when motion is detected.
- Adjustable sensitivity settings for motion detection.
- Cross-platform compatibility (Windows, macOS, Linux).
